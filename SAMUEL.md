## Tasks

Hey Samuel, I mentioned I would pass on the info about what we’re looking for.
My guess is you’d want to be more involved in the ML part of the project no?
This is really a web development project.

Here’s a description:
We’re looking for a developer to create an instance of Mozilla Common Voice (https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice) the stack is Docker, React, TypeScript, MySQL, S3.
Common Voice was set up to do crowd-source recording of audio, so there are some changes that would need to be made.
Namely:
- we need the data to be unavailable to the public
- we need registration to be limited
- we need minor style and markup changes (ie taking away the language around Mozilla and adding some markup around the project)
- Common Voice currently collects audio in a lossy format (mp3), we need to change this to lossless
  16bit, 48k sample rate, lossless wav files
- Perhaps add some server-side scripting to automate signal processing/de-noising/backup

Let me know if you have any questions though!
